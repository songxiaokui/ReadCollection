#### What Is Redis?
>   In simple words, Redis is an in-memory data structure store and is mainly popular for its very low-level latency. It
is in-memory means that the time taken to access the data is very low compared to in-disk databases. This can be useful
for applications that require fast data access and  manipulation, such as real-time bidding systems or gaming servers.
Redis is a key-value store, which means that it stores data in the form of key-value pairs. The key is used to access the
value, and the value can be of any type such as a string, a list, a set, a sorted set, a hash. these data types are supported
natively by Redis and provide a rich set of commands for manipulating and querying the data. In addition to these data
types, Redis can be extended with Redis modules. Some of these modules are provided by Redis Labs and some are provided by
the community. In conclusion, Redis is a popular and robust data management tool that is widely used by organizations for
a variety of purpose. Its key feature and benefits include high performance, flexibility, and support for a wide range of
data structures. Once you han installed it, you can use a variety of basic Redis commands I would encourage you experiment
with Redis and explore its capability to gain a deeper understanding of how it can help you organization.
